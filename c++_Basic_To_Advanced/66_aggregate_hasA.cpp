For this reason inheritance is often called a “kind of” relationship.
Aggregation is called a “has a” relationship. We say a library has a book or an invoice has an
item line. Aggregation is also called a “part-whole” relationship: the book is part of the library.
In object-oriented programming, aggregation may occur when one object is an attribute of
another. Here’s a case where an object of class A is an attribute of class B:
class A
{
};
class B
{
A objA; // define objA as an object of class A
};

*/
